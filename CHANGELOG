1.0.2
=====
:release-date: 2017-09-21
:by: Ian Douglas

* updating Go language version support on Travis-CI

1.0.1
=====

* forcing GET requests to not have a body payload; this shouldn't break anything

1.0.0
=====
* breaking changes:
  * actors, objects and targets no longer need to be FeedID values, just strings
* non-breaking changes:
  * foreign id no longer has to be a UUID, it can be a string as well

0.9.2
=====
* fixed a permission issue with updated activities, and have changed the auth mechanism for them from
being signature-based to being JWT-based instead; this will throw a permission error on our API in the
future.

0.9.1
=====
* fixed bugs against Go 1.5 and 1.6 for some http.Transport flags that weren't introduced until 1.7
* added additional logic and code to test against our QA environment
* removed code and tests for following Aggregated and Notification feeds, which wasn't possible on the API anyway
* added GPLv3 LICENSE from mrhenry's build from which we did our original fork

0.9.0
=====
* initial beta release
